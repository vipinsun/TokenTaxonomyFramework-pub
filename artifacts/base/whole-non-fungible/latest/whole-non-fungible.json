Meaning there would be only a single piece of art represented by the token class. If the art cannot be sub-divided, meaning there can be no fractional owners, this token class can be a singleton if the quantity in the class is set to 1. A singleton has only one instance in the class, essentially meaning the class is the instance, and not be sub-dividable and no new tokens can be minted in the class.",
