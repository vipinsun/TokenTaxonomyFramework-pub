      "businessDescription": "Grantable represents 'potential' ownership of a token when granted to a user. A grantable token is 'granted' to an account, but the account isn't the owner or free to spend or transfer the granted token. The account will become the owner or be able to spend or redeem the token when the grant vests. A grant that is vested is transformed in some way, usually allowing the owner to redeem or use the token itself. A token class that implements this behavior will support grant settings to define the rules for vesting of the grant. Grant settings include a vesting schedule and vest actions for setting when a vest can occur and what happens when it vests. Vesting can have a date when it is able to vest, but is not automatic, it must be invoked. Simple vests will remove a transferable/burnable restriction so that the token can be redeemed. More complex vesting can spawn new tokens with issuance being sent to multiple parties.",
      "businessExample": "A grantable token can be granted to an account with a simple date based vest.  The vest can be a single date or on a schedule spanning years. A 5 year grant would vest 20% of the grant every calendar year from the initial grant date. The vest event can also be a simple 'unlocking' of the token so the grantee can use it or more complex like splitting percentages into multiple other tokens.",
